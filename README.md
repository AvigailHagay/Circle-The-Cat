# Circle the Cat Game
Author: Avigail Hagay

Circle the Cat is a game where the user plays against the computer. The user's objective is to circle the computer's cat while the computer tries to escape. The game is based on the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm and implemented using C++ and the Standard Template Library (STL). The game also uses the SFML library for graphics and user interface.

How to play

The game is played on a grid where the user controls a cursor and the computer controls the cat. The user's goal is to surround the cat with their cursor, trapping it and winning the game. The cat, controlled by the computer, will move around the grid in an attempt to evade the user's cursor.

The user controls the cursor using the arrow keys on their keyboard, and can move it up, down, left, or right on the grid. The cat's movements are determined by an algorithm, specifically the Breadth-First Search algorithm, which allows it to move strategically and avoid the user's cursor.

The game is won when the user successfully surrounds the cat with their cursor, trapping it. If the cat catches the user's cursor, the game is lost.

Tips and Tricks

Keep an eye on the cat's movements and try to predict where it will go next
Don't rush and take your time to plan your moves
Use walls and obstacles on the grid to your advantage

Technical Information

The game uses a modified version of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, for the computer's cat to move on the grid. This ensures that the cat's movements are optimized and challenging for the user to trap.
The game is built using the SFML library for graphics and user input, and data structures such as queue and sets to implement the Breadth-First Search algorithm for the cat's movements.

Conclusion

Circle the Cat is a fun and challenging game that requires strategy and patience. It's a great way to test your problem solving skills while having fun. Good luck and have fun!
